Real-Time Weapon Detection System using Generative AI & YOLO in Flask

Our AI-powered weapon detection system utilizes Generative AI and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time surveillance and automatic threat detection through CCTV feeds. Built with Flask, this solution is designed for high-speed, accurate detection of firearms, knives, and other weapons in public places, critical infrastructure, and high-security zones.

Key Features:

Real-Time Weapon Detection:

Uses YOLO-based deep learning models fine-tuned on diverse datasets to detect a wide range of weapons.
Processes live CCTV footage with minimal latency.
High detection accuracy even in crowded environments.

Advanced AI & Computer Vision:

Fine-tuned Generative AI models for improved weapon classification and reduced false positives.
Can detect concealed weapons under certain conditions using enhanced image analysis.
Works under various lighting and weather conditions.

Instant Alerts & Notifications:

Automated real-time alerts sent to police, military, and security agencies upon detection.
Alerts include weapon type, location, and timestamp.
Can trigger alarms or emergency protocols in security control centers.

Seamless Integration with Surveillance Systems:

Compatible with existing CCTV infrastructure without additional hardware.
Supports multiple video feeds simultaneously.
Cloud-based or on-premise deployment options for flexible scalability.

Live Dashboard & Monitoring:

Web-based interface built with Flask for monitoring detections in real time.
Graphical analysis and incident reports for security teams.
Role-based access for law enforcement and security personnel.

Customizable & Scalable Solution:

Model can be fine-tuned for specific environments like airports, schools, stadiums, and government facilities.
Can be integrated with facial recognition and anomaly detection for enhanced security.
Supports API-based integration with law enforcement databases.

Privacy-Focused & Ethical AI Compliance:

Processes data in real-time without storing personal footage, ensuring privacy.
Adheres to AI ethics guidelines to prevent misuse.
Logs detections while maintaining GDPR and security compliance.


Applications:

✅ Public Safety & Law Enforcement – Monitors streets, public transport, and crowded areas.
✅ Defense & Military – Enhances security at border checkpoints and military bases.
✅ Airports & Transport Hubs – Prevents threats in high-traffic zones.
✅ Schools & Universities – Ensures a safe learning environment.
✅ Corporate & Private Security – Protects offices, events, and private premises.


Conclusion:

This real-time weapon detection system combines deep learning, computer vision, and AI-powered automation to deliver proactive security.
